# CountryInfoApp
Country Information App  Part 1 Create a Node.js application that does the following: - Takes in one parameter from the command line, the name of a country. Note: command line arguments can be read from the global array `process.argv` - Reads and parses the `countries.json` file. Note: you must use readFile and not readFileSync. Get it here: countries.jsonView in a new window - Outputs information about that specific country. Must be in the following format: Country: &lt;country name> Top Level Domain: &lt;tld>  Part 2 - For the purposes of this exercise, you must create a separate module for reading and parsing the JSON file, named "json-file-reader". - This module should have a function that takes in a filename and a callback function as a parameter. It should then read that file, then parse the JSON. Finally, it should call the callback function and pass the parsed JSON to it. - One way to think of this module is as a helper that can read and parse any JSON file. It has nothing to do with 'countries', so to speak. - Another way to think of it is as a small wrapper to fs.readFile, except that this function only works with JSON files.  - The output of the application should have the following format:   Country: &lt;country name> Top Level Domain: &lt;tld>
